# CodeTantra Bypass Demo

## Overview
The CodeTantra Bypass Demo provides a limited, one-time-use experience of the bypass features available with CodeTantra Bypass. This demo is designed solely for testing purposes and is restricted in both duration and functionality.

## How to Use the Demo

1. **Single Use & Time Limit**  
   - The demo will work only once and remains active for 10 minutes.

2. **Starting the Demo**  
   - Begin the demo **before** launching the CodeTantra App.
   - After starting the demo, open the CodeTantra App and proceed with your test.

3. **Feature Limitations**  
   - The demo does not remove the timer or support any inbuilt autotype/paste functionalities. However, you can use your own autotyper. The demo bypass removes the autotyper blocks in place so any autotyper can work during the 10 minutes.
